# Hello, I'm Dee ðŸ‘‹

Some of my stuff on Github you can look at:

* [DeeUnderscore/bookwyrm](https://github.com/DeeUnderscore/bookwyrm/tree/nix/nix) â€“ a soft fork of Bookwyrm, adapted for running on NixOS (also possibly via flake)
* [nfortune](https://github.com/DeeUnderscore/nfortune) â€“ fortune, but in Nim
* [cubeglobe](https://github.com/DeeUnderscore/cubeglobe) â€“ library for randomly generating isometric landscapes

If you would like to contact me, refer to [my website](https://dee.underscore.world/about/#Contact).
